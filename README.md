# NanoDatacenter
Material for my Nano-drive datacenter presentation. Everything is included as-is and with no warranty or guarantee. You should consider everything in this repository as educational material. 

_**Nothing**_ is considered ready for a production environment.

### Update 3 October 2017
Because of the direction Microsoft is going with Nano Server, this presentation and all demo files are essentially obsolete. At some point I will remove this repository from public view.
